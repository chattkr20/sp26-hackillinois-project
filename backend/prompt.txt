"Task: Extract structured information from the provided audio transcript. 
Identify every "Part Name" mentioned and provide the corresponding "Part Details" (such as dimensions, material, condition, or associated SKU).

Guidelines:
1. List each part clearly.
2. If details are not explicitly mentioned for a part, label it as "Not specified".
3. Use a structured JSON format for the output.

Example 1:
Transcript: "We checked the intake valve and noticed some carbon buildup. The gasket, which is the 4-inch rubber model, looks brand new."
Reasoning: 
- The speaker mentions "intake valve". The detail provided is "carbon buildup".
- The speaker mentions "gasket". The details provided are "4-inch", "rubber", and "looks brand new".
Output:
[
  {"part_name": "intake valve", "part_details": "carbon buildup"},
  {"part_name": "gasket", "part_details": "4-inch, rubber, brand new"}
]
